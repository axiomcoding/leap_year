# Leap Year
Leap years are kind of a weird thing, but we need to make sure our programs account for that extra day every 4 years. Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year using the official leap year rules:  

- a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4  
  - i.e. 1996 and 2012 are leap years
- a year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 UNLESS the year is also divisible by 400
  - i.e. 1600 and 2000 are leaps years but 1300 and 1500 are NOT leap years
